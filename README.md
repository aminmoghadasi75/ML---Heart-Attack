# Heart Attack Classification Dataset

This dataset contains information that can be used to predict the likelihood of a heart attack in individuals based on various health parameters.

## Overview

Heart disease is a significant health issue worldwide, and predictive models can help in identifying individuals at risk. This dataset includes a collection of attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical measurements that are commonly associated with heart health.

## Source

The dataset was sourced from [Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com) and has been preprocessed for use in machine learning models. Please refer to the original source for any specific details regarding data collection methodology or updates.

## Content

The dataset comprises the following columns:

- **age:** Age of the individual (in years)
- **sex:** Gender of the individual (0 = female, 1 = male)
- **cp:** Chest pain type (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic)
- **trestbps:** Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission)
- **chol:** Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl)
- **fbs:** Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (0 = false, 1 = true)
- **restecg:** Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
- **thalach:** Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang:** Exercise induced angina (0 = no, 1 = yes)
- **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope:** The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping)
- **ca:** Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
- **thal:** Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)
- **target:** Presence of heart disease (0 = no heart disease, 1 = presence of heart disease)

## Usage

This dataset can be utilized for tasks such as:

- Predictive modeling to forecast the likelihood of heart disease based on various attributes.
- Exploratory data analysis to identify correlations and patterns related to heart health.
